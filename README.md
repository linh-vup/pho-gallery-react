# Project is WIP

Code along to SupherHi's [Intro to React.js](https://www.superhi.com/courses/intro-to-react-javascript) Chapter 1 project (Zesty) with a personal tweak to build a simple photo gallery website with loading state.

Personalisation: Making it a gallery of Dall-E generated images of pho, based on different style prompts.

# New Things Learned/Used

- using CSS text-rendering prop
- --webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
- linking google fonts in html rather than importing into css (https://sia.codes/posts/making-google-fonts-faster/)
- using vw for fonts to make it responsive to page size
- installed extension to easily convert px to rem
- progress html element
- functional component with implicit return with parenthesis, component being child component in same file, without having to export in app component
